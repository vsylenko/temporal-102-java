# Exercise 2: Testing the Translation Workflow

During this exercise, you will

- Run a unit test provided for the `translateTerm` Activity
- Develop and run your own unit test for the `translateTerm` Activity
- Write assertions for a Workflow test
- Uncover, diagnose, and fix a bug in the Workflow Definition
- Observe the time-skipping feature in the Workflow test environment

Make your changes to the code in the `practice` subdirectory (look for
`TODO` comments that will guide you to where you should make changes to
the code). If you need a hint or want to verify your changes, look at
the complete version in the `solution` subdirectory.

## Prerequisite: Ensure the Microservice is running

If you haven't already started the Translation Microservice used by this exercise,
do so in a separate terminal.

**Note: If you're using the Gitpod environment to run this exercise you can
skip this step. An instance of the Microservice is already running in your
environment**

1. Navigate to the `utilities` directory at the root level of the course
2. Change into the `microservice` directory
   1. `cd utilities/microservice`
3. Compile the microservice
   1. `mvn clean compile`
4. Start the microservice
   1. `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="translationapi.Microservice"`

## Part A: Running a Test

We have provided a unit test for the `translateTerm` Activity
to get you started. This test verifies that the Activity correctly
translates the term "Hello" to German. Take a moment to study the
test, which you'll find in the `TranslationActivitiesTest.java` file in the
`src/test/java/translationworkflow` directory. Since the test runs the
Activity, which in turn calls the microservice to do the translation, ensure
that your microservice is running as state above. Then run the test.

1. Run the `mvn test` command to execute the provided test

## Part B: Write and Run Another Test for the Activity

Now it's time to develop and run your own unit test, this time
verifying that the Activity correctly supports the translation
of a different word in a different language.

1. Edit the `TranslationActivitiesTest.java` file
2. Copy the `testSuccessfulTranslateActivityHelloGerman` method,
   renaming the new method as `testSuccessfulTranslateActivityGoodbyeLatvian`
3. Change the term for the input from `hello` to `goodbye`
4. Change the language code for the input from `de` (German) to `lv` (Latvian)
5. Assert that translation returned by the Activity is `Ardievu`
6. Run `mvn test` again to run this new test, in addition to the others

## Part C: Test the Activity with Invalid Input

In addition to verifying that your code behaves correctly when used as
you intended, it is sometimes also helpful to verify its behavior with
unexpected input. The example below does this, testing that the Activity
returns the appropriate error when called with an invalid language code.

```java
  @Test
  public void testFailedTranslateActivityBadLanguageCode() {
     testEnvironment.registerActivitiesImplementations(new TranslationActivitiesImpl());
     TranslationActivities activity = testEnvironment.newActivityStub(TranslationActivities.class);
     TranslationActivityInput input = new TranslationActivityInput("goodbye", "xq");

     // Assert that an error was thrown and it was an Activity Failure
     Exception exception = assertThrows(ActivityFailure.class, () -> {
        TranslationActivityOutput output = activity.translateTerm(input);
     });

     // Assert that the error has the expected message, which identifies
     // the invalid language code as the cause
     assertTrue(exception.getMessage().contains(
         "Invalid language code"),
         "expected error message");
  }
```

Take a moment to study this code, and then continue with the
following steps:

1. Edit the `TranslationActivitiesTest.java` file
2. Uncomment the imports on lines 4 (`assertThrows`) and 11 (`ActivityFailure`)
3. Copy the entire `testFailedTranslateActivityBadLanguageCode` method
   provided above and paste it at the bottom of the `TranslationActivitiesTest.java` file
4. Save the changes
5. Run `mvn test` again to run this new test, in addition to the others

## Part D: Test a Workflow Definition

1. Edit the `TranslationWorkflowTest.java` file in the
   `src/test/java/translationworkflow` directory
2. Add assertions for the following conditions to the `testSuccessfulTranslation` test
   - The `helloMessage` field in the result is `Bonjour, Pierre`
   - The `goodbyeMessage` field in the result is `Au revoir, Pierre`
3. Save your changes
4. Run `mvn test`. This will fail, due to a bug in the Workflow Definition.
5. Find and fix the bug in the Workflow Definition
6. Run the `mvn test` command again to verify that you fixed the bug

There are two things to note about this test.

First, the test completes in a few seconds, even though the Workflow
Definition contains a `Workflow.Sleep` call that adds a 30-second delay
to the Workflow Execution. This is because of the time-skipping feature
provided by the test environment.

Second, calls to `registerActivitiesImplementations` near the top of the test indicate
that the Activity Definitions are executed as part of this Workflow
test. As you learned, you can test your Workflow Definition in isolation
from the Activity implementations by using mocks. The optional exercise
that follows provides an opportunity to try this for yourself.

### This is the end of the exercise.

## (Optional) Using Mock Activities in a Workflow Test

If you have time and would like an additional challenge,
continue with the following steps.

1. Make a copy of the existing Workflow Test by running
   `cp src/test/java/translationworkflow/TranslationWorkflowTest.java src/test/java/translationworkflow/TranslationWorkflowMockTest.java`
2. Edit the `TranslationWorkflowMockTest.java` file
3. Rename the class to `TranslationWorkflowMockTest`
4. Add an import `import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;`
5. Rename the test function to `testSuccessfulTranslationWithMocks`
6. Add the following code to the beginning of the `testSuccessfulTranslationWithMocks` method

```java
TranslationActivities mockedActivities = mock(TranslationActivities.class, withSettings().withoutAnnotations());
when(mockedActivities.translateTerm(new TranslationActivityInput("hello", "fr")))
   .thenReturn(new TranslationActivityOutput("Bonjour"));
```

7. Copy the second line from the above code beginning with `when` and modify it
   to mock the `translateTerm` Activity to return `Au revoir` when `goodbye` is passed
   with the `fr` language code specified.
8. Modify the Worker registration line to use the new `mockedActivities` instance.
9. Save your changes
10. Add the following code at the bottom of the `TranslateActivityInput` class.
    - Why is this necessary? If you ran the test now as written, it would fail.
      This is because comparisons of the `TranslateActivityInput` objects (as
      with all objects in Java) invoke its `equals` method. Because this class
      does not override that method, it inherits the behavior of its parent
      (in this case, `java.lang.Object`, which compares the identity of the
      objects. To solve this, you must override the method to compare the
      the equality of the `term` and `languageCode` fields. Since you are
      overriding the `equals` method, it is also standard Java practice to
      override the `hashCode` method to ensure that two equal objects will
      return identical hash codes.

```java
  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj) {
      return true;
    }
    if (obj == null) {
      return false;
    }
    if (getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
      return false;
    }
    final TranslationActivityInput other = (TranslationActivityInput) obj;
    if (!Objects.equals(this.term, other.term)) {
      return false;
    }
    return Objects.equals(this.languageCode, other.languageCode);
  }

  @Override
  public int hashCode() {
    int hash = 3;
    hash = 53 * hash + Objects.hashCode(this.term);
    hash = 53 * hash + Objects.hashCode(this.languageCode);
    return hash;
  }
```

11. Save your changes
12. Run `mvn test` to run the tests
